# LIVEâ€‘Userâ€‘Engagement: Engagement Forecasting & Hybrid Recommender System ðŸš€

A full-stack video analytics and recommendation pipeline built around TikTokâ€‘style live and shortâ€‘form video engagement. It includes forecasting likeâ€‘counts, personalized recommendations, and interactive visualization of results.

---

## Project Overview

- **Predict LIVE-style Engagement**: Trained deep learning regression models (TensorFlow/Keras) to forecast `likeCount` using engineered featuresâ€”achieving ~90% reduction in MAE vs. baseline.
- **Hybrid Recommender Engine**: Combined collaborative filtering (SVD via Surprise) and content-based filtering (TF-IDF + cosine similarity), with cold-start support using metadata like descriptions and categories.
- **Feature Engineering & Data Pipelines**: Created features from metadata (e.g., duration bins, verified creator flags, engagement per user) and transformed raw logs into user-item matrices and embeddings.
- **Metric & Causal Analysis Simulation**: Designed metrics for product health, implemented MAE benchmarking, and simulated A/B testing and causal inference to assess model impact.
- **Visualization Dashboard**: Built a Streamlit interface for stakeholders to explore predictions, recommendation results, feature importance, and business insights.

## Impact and Business Alignment 
1. Enhances user experience by recommending videos tailored to user behavior and content metadata, even in coldâ€‘start situations.
2. Supports creator ecosystem by enabling discovery of similar content to boost visibility and engagement.
3. Enables algorithmic improvement by exposing forecast accuracy and recommendations through metrics and dashboards for iterative evaluation.
